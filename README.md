## About

The Paris Housing Price Prediction project aims to build and evaluate several regression models to predict housing prices based on various features such as size, location, and property characteristics.  
This serves as a practical case study for regression tasks and model comparison using real estate data.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle - Paris Housing Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/paris-housing-price-prediction).  
It contains approximately 8,000 entries with the following features:

- Square meters of living area (`squareMeters`)
- Number of rooms (`numberOfRooms`)
- Number of bedrooms (`numberOfBedrooms`)
- Number of floors (`floors`)
- Latitude and longitude (geographical coordinates)
- Lot area (`lotArea`)
- Additional features such as presence of a pool, garage, basement, year built, and more.
---

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset was already clean, with no missing values or need for transformations.  
This allowed us to directly use the features for modeling without additional preprocessing steps.

## Models Used

- **Linear Regression:** baseline model for simple linear relationships
- **Decision Tree Regressor:** non-linear model with interpretable tree structure
- **Random Forest Regressor:** ensemble of decision trees to reduce overfitting
- **XGBoost Regressor:** gradient boosting model known for high performance

## Evaluation Metrics

Models are evaluated with common regression metrics:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** measures average magnitude of errors
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** average absolute differences between predictions and actual values
- **R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination):** proportion of variance explained by the model

These metrics provide complementary views on model performance.

## Conclusion

Linear Regression performed very well due to the presence of a dominant feature strongly correlated with the target variable.  
Tree-based models like Decision Trees and Random Forests showed competitive results, especially after hyperparameter tuning with Optuna.  
Future improvements could include testing regularization methods such as LASSO or Ridge regression, and exploring deep learning approaches.
