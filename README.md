# 🏠 Paris Housing Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in Paris using various regression models.  
The goal is to compare the performance of different algorithms and build a robust pipeline for price estimation.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/paris-housing-price-prediction) and includes features such as:
- Square meters of living area
- Number of rooms
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of floors
- Geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude)
- Area of the lot

## 🧠 Models Used

- 📈 Linear Regression  
- 🌳 Decision Tree Regressor  
- 🌲 Random Forest Regressor  
- ⚡ XGBoost Regressor

## 🔧 Objectives

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization if needed)
- Model training and evaluation
- Model comparison (via RMSE, MAE, R²)
- Visualization of predictions and residuals

## 📦 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
